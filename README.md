# ðŸ‘¤ About Me

I'm a young programmer who loves creating things using code. 

I started programming around 2018, at the time I used to play Roblox, a gaming platform where users can play and create their own games. 

Sometimes I created games using Roblox Studio, most of them I never got to complete, but they helped me a lot to understand programming logic, and also the Lua language. I published some games, but very few people used to play those games. 

Until, in 2021, I join in a game jam created by Duolingo. With just 3 days to create the game, I published my game called Flappy Duo, which currently has almost 1 million visits.

Nowadays, I don't intend to make games on Roblox anymore, but I continue to do programming projects with various languages such as Python, JavaScript and a few others.
